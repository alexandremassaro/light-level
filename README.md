# light-level

## Overview

### Whats is this?
This code was created as an test for an new project that will use a device camera to measure light level and adjust light intensity for indoors agriculture. 
It could be used for individual light intensity measuring and control, or an overall monitoring.

### Why would you do that?
Of course there are a lot of other (even easier or more trustwothy) methods to achieve this goal, but as our client explicitly asked for a solution that used a webcam or a smartphone camera, I decided to create this test script to show him if the level of precision would attend to his requirements.
